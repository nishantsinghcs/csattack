Other battery types cannot withstand long high-rate over-charging; the charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to adjust the charging current, and cut off at the end of charge. A trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Slow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge; high-rate chargers may restore most capacity within minutes or less than an hour, but generally require monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharge.

The&nbsp;<strong>BlackBerry Z10</strong>&nbsp;is the first of the brand&rsquo;s new range of phones running on the BlackBerry 10 operating system that offers fast and compelling user experience. The<strong>&nbsp;1.5 GHz Dual Core processor</strong>&nbsp;with 2 GB RAM offers impressive support that ensures there are no lags and that the phone runs smoothly. But what you really have to love is the&nbsp;<strong>4.2 inch touchscreen</strong>&nbsp;that doesn&rsquo;t miss a beat. The WXGA&nbsp;<strong>capacitive touchscreen&nbsp;</strong>supports 1280 x 768 pixel resolution and gives you great display and gesture support delivers satisfying navigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major highlight of the Z10 is its<strong>&nbsp;8 MP camera</strong>. With<strong>&nbsp;5x zoom</strong>&nbsp;and a host of nifty camera features, taking pictures on this smartphone is a true joy. The 2 MP secondary camera and<strong>&nbsp;full HD video recording&nbsp;</strong>capabilities add to the appeal of the Z10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping up with times and user needs, the BlackBerry Z10 brings you the seamless possibilities of two features which are&nbsp;<strong>BlackBerry Hub&nbsp;</strong>and BlackBerry Flow. The Hub feature allows you to keep all your incoming messages in one place and keep track of all your meetings and calendar events. The Flow feature refers to the BlackBerry&rsquo;s ability to switch between applications quickly and flawlessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Z10 has a simple yet appealing design with a bold bar-shaped rectangular body and rounded edges. The phone has done away with navigational buttons, the only physical buttons you will find are the volume rocker and mute button on the right and the power button on top which sits next to the&nbsp;<strong>3.5 mm audio jack</strong>. The USB and micro HDMI ports are on the left.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Storage and Battery</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a big internal memory of&nbsp;<strong>16 GB</strong>&nbsp;and an expandable memory of up to 64 GB (using micro SD), you can store music, movies and data on the phone with ease. The 1800 mAh battery supports up to&nbsp;<strong>10 hours of talktime</strong>&nbsp;on 2G and 11 hours on 3G. You enjoy up to 397 hours of standby time on 2G and 408 hours on 3G.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Connectivity and Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Networking and staying connected with the world are made simpler with&nbsp;<strong>EDGE, 3G and Wi-Fi&nbsp;</strong>that ensure uninterrupted internet connectivity. With pre-installed apps like<strong>&nbsp;Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn</strong>&nbsp;you can keep your personal and professional contacts close and updated. The&nbsp;<strong>Bluetooth</strong>&nbsp;feature lets you share music, videos and other data wirelessly and with complete ease. To sum up, the BlackBerry Z10 presents a host of features and advanced technology that make your user-experience fun and easy.</p>', 'blackberry z11 mobile phone', 'blackberry z11 mobile phone', 'blackberry z11 mobile phone', 'Active', 1383043903),

Is that going to be enough to impress the baying hoardes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ve been here before: the iPhone &#39;S&#39; conundrum. The new phone comes along, taking the shell of the previous model, adds some new bits and pieces, and then claims to be an entirely new phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which it is, of course. But also it isn&#39;t. Well, mostly is. To be sure, it&#39;s the kind of move that only Apple can pull off with any kind of conviction: the notion that it can take the same chassis, have a little tinker, throw in a new CPU, slightly better battery and camera, and call it an all-conquering device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then again, such is the clamour to know all about it, is that such a bad move? There are literally millions of people the world over who can&#39;t wait to see what the next handset from Apple will be, and there was no surprise with the iPhone 5S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few who question whether it&#39;s &#39;fair&#39; to launch a phone and then append an &#39;S&#39; to the same thing a year later - Apple&#39;s response would likely be that nobody is forcing you to buy the new hardware. And that&#39;s a fair point. Yes, this is a phone that bears far too many hallmarks of its predecessor. And yes, this is the third time Apple has done this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s also managed to try to pop it onto the market complete as one of the most expensive smartphones out there, even on 3G plans. You&#39;ll be looking at post &pound;50 a month to get one without an upfront fee in the UK, and &pound;549 will be the price if you want the low end model, pushing all the way up to over &pound;700 for the 64GB variant.</p>', 'Iphone 5S', 'IPhone 5S', 'IPhone 5S', 'Active', 1383043971);
